# A Dual Refinement Mechanism for Real-World Visual Detection

## Inrtroduction
This repository is initially based on [ssd.pytorch](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), and some modules are from [RFBNet](https://github.com/ruinmessi/RFBNet) and [deformable-convolution-pytorch](https://github.com/1zb/deformable-convolution-pytorch), a huge thank to them.

We currently only support PyTorch-0.4.0 and Python 3. `./make.sh` is required for DeformableConv and COCO tools during installation.
